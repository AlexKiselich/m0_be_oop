# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This was a tough CFU but I feel like I did a good job on it. I had to go back and look through some notes and it took me longer to complete than usual but wehn I finished I felt like the king of the world! 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I do need to take more breaks but all in all I was very focused and wanted to get the job done right.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I want to remember that it's ok to not know how to do something, you have to keep trying new ways to solve problems. Reach out to others if you need help, and finally take a break every once in awhile.
